# Richardson Lucy Deconvolution

[Richardson Lucy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson%E2%80%93Lucy_deconvolution)  is an iterative deconvolution algorithm that can be used to reconstruct a blurred image.

## Richardson Lucy with Total Variation Regularization  
To prevent noise amplification the Richardson Lucy algorithm should be regularized. Richardson Lucy with Total Variation Regularization is described [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16586486/)
